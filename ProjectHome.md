<h1>What is jPlex ?</h1>
jPlex is a javascript library that provides a set of usual user-interface components and some functions to help the everyday's life of a webdevelopper. It focuses on components that you can find on each web-application like calendar, menubar or windows. This library is based on the powerful combination <a href='http://prototypejs.org/'>Prototype</a>/<a href='http://script.aculo.us/'>Scriptaculous</a>.<br>
<br>
jPlex clashes around 3 keywords :<br>
<ul><li>Simple: Invoke complex components in one line<br>
</li><li>Compatible: Each feature has been tested on <img src='http://tls.wydd.free.fr/icon/ie.png' /> 6+, <img src='http://tls.wydd.free.fr/icon/firefox.png' /> 2+, <img src='http://tls.wydd.free.fr/icon/safari.png' /> Win/Mac 3+, <img src='http://tls.wydd.free.fr/icon/chrome.png' />, <img src='http://tls.wydd.free.fr/icon/opera.png' /> 9.5+<br>
</li><li>Customizable: Adapt the components to your design just by overriding the css rules</li></ul>

<h1>Why jPlex ?</h1>

<ul><li>When you develop, you need to redo each component by yourself. The calendar is the ultimate example: look around some website. Each one is specific and if you need to ensure compatibility you can do a lot of boring work.<br>
There are a lot of library like this one: <a href='http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/'>YUI</a>, <a href='http://www.livepipe.net/'>LivePipe</a> or monolithic components. So why choose jPlex ?<br>
</li><li>We rely on the framework Prototype, which is a really simple and compatible one. A lot of web developer agrees on that but does use YUI instead for example because it is too low level. Scriptaculous provides graphical effects and some very useful tools like drag'n'drop, but does not give calendar or tabs. We provide the last piece of the puzzle to form a full framework.<br>
</li><li>jPlex has been designed with a complete software design in order to have a great code quality. We rely on the Class creation of Prototype in order to have an component-oriented library. By this mean it is really easy to add components or customize them.<br>
</li><li>You can create your own component for yourself via our <a href='APIPangolin.md'>API</a>
</li><li>jPlex provides XPrototype: A complete prototype extension in order to give to the developer a lot of functions that each developer has coded into a "util.js". Example: Date.format or Number.format, Date.previousMonth<br>
</li><li>jPlex is delivered in a single compressed file in order to have great performance. Of course if you prefer debugging you can use the source tree that works as well.<br>
</li><li>It's an open-source project: You can modify everything (as long as you respect the MIT Licence)</li></ul>

<h1>Who develops jPlex ?</h1>

The main contributors of jPlex are Jean-Luc Dagon (Exalead Labs) and Lo√Øc Petit (Laboratory of Informatics Grenoble), both web-developper addicted to JavaScript.<br>
