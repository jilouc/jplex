        <h2>What is jPlex ?</h2>

        <p>
            jPlex is a javascript library that provides a set of usual user-interface components and some
            functions to help the everyday's life of a webdevelopper. It focuses on components that you can
            find on each web-application like calendar, menubar or windows.<br/>
            This library is based on the powerful combination <em>Prototype/Scriptaculous</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            You are currently on the provided <em>window system</em>
            <br/>Look at the top of the window, you can see the menubar for further demo. Enjoy!"
        </p>

        <p>
            jPlex clashes around 3 keywords :

        <ul>
            <li>Simple: Invoke complex components in one line</li>
            <li>Compatible: Each feature has been tested on <img src="./global/img/ie.png" alt="ie" align="absmiddle"/>6.0+,
                <img src="./global/img/firefox.png" alt="firefox" align="absmiddle"/> 2.0,
                <img src="./global/img/safari.png" alt="safari" align="absmiddle"/> Win/Mac 3.0+,
                <img src="./global/img/chrome.png" alt="chrome" align="absmiddle"/> ,
                <img src="./global/img/opera.png" alt="opera" align="absmiddle"/> 9+
            </li>
            <li>Customizable: Adapt the components to your design just by overriding the css rules</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why jPlex ?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li> When you develop, you need to redo each component by yourself. The calendar is the ultimate example:
                look
                around some website. Each one is specific and if you need to ensure compatibility you can do a lot of
                boring
                work.
            </li>
        </ul>

        There is a lot of library like this one: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! UI</a>, <a
            href="http://livepipe.net/">LivePipe</a>? or monolithic components. So why choose jPlex ?

        <ul>
            <li>We rely on the framework Prototype, which is a really simple and compatible one. A lot of web developer
                agrees
                on that but does use YUI instead for example because it is too low level. Scriptaculous provides
                graphical
                effects and some very useful tools like drag'n'drop, but does not give calendar or tabs. We provide the
                last
                piece of the puzzle to form a full framework.
            </li>
            <li>jPlex has been designed with a complete software design in order to have a great code quality. We rely
                on the
                Class creation of Prototype in order to have an object-oriented library. By this mean it is really easy
                to add
                components or customize them.
            </li>
            <li>You can create your own component for yourself via our API</li>
            <li>jPlex provides XPrototype: A complete prototype extension in order to give to the developer a lot of
                functions
                that each developer has coded into a "util.js". Example: Date.format or Number.format,
                Date.previousMonth
            </li>
            <li>jPlex is delivered in a single compressed file in order to have great performance. Of course if you
                prefer
                debugging you can use the source tree that works as well.
            </li>
            <li>It's an open-source project: You can modify everything (as long as you respect the MIT Licence)</li>
        </ul>
